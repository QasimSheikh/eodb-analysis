# EODB Analysis System Documentation

## 1. System Overview
The EODB (End of Day Balance) Analysis System is a robust tool designed for analyzing banking account behaviors through state transitions and Bayesian prediction. It processes time series data in stages to identify patterns and predict future states, aiding in behavioral insights and decision-making.

## 3. Usage Examples

### 3.1 **Basic Usage**
```python
# Initialize components
binner = GeometricBinner()
state_mapper = StateMapper(binner)
transition_matrix = TransitionMatrix(n_states=1000)

# Process raw EODB data
transition_matrix = process_eodb_batch_with_transitions(
    eodb_files, state_mapper, transition_matrix
)

# Make predictions
predictor = BayesianPredictor(transition_matrix)
next_states = predictor.predict_next_state(current_state, n_steps=3)
```
